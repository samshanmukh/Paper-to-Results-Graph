/**
 * Event type enumeration for sophisticated client subscription and event routing.
 *
 * This enumeration defines event categories used for intelligent event filtering
 * and routing in multi-client environments. It enables clients to subscribe
 * to specific types of events based on their needs and capabilities, reducing
 * network traffic and improving system performance.
 *
 * Event Categories:
 * ----------------
 * NONE: Unsubscribe from all events (cleanup and disconnection)
 * ALL: Subscribe to all events regardless of category (comprehensive monitoring)
 * DEBUGGER: Debug-specific events for debugging protocol communication
 * DETAIL: Real-time processing events requiring immediate client attention
 * SUMMARY: Periodic status summaries suitable for dashboard monitoring
 * OUTPUT: Standard output and logging messages
 * FLOW: Pipeline flow events - component execution tracking
 * TASK: Task lifecycle events - start, stop, state changes
 *
 * Subscription Strategies:
 * -----------------------
 * NONE: Used during client disconnection to stop all event delivery
 *       and perform cleanup of monitoring subscriptions.
 *
 * ALL: Comprehensive monitoring for administrative clients that need
 *      complete visibility into task execution and debugging activities.
 *
 * DEBUGGER: Debug protocol events including breakpoint hits, variable
 *           changes, stack traces, and debugging session management.
 *
 * DETAIL: Real-time processing events including object processing updates,
 *         error/warning messages, metrics updates, and immediate status
 *         changes requiring client response or display updates.
 *
 * SUMMARY: Periodic status summaries sent at CONST_STATUS_UPDATE_FREQ
 *          intervals containing complete task status, suitable for
 *          monitoring dashboards and periodic client updates.
 *
 * OUTPUT: Standard output and logging messages from task execution.
 *
 * FLOW: Pipeline flow events tracking component execution, data flow
 *       between pipeline stages, and processing pipeline status.
 *
 * TASK: Task lifecycle events including task start, stop, pause, resume,
 *       and state changes for task management interfaces.
 *
 * Network Optimization:
 * --------------------
 * Event filtering reduces network traffic by sending only relevant events
 * to interested clients. SUMMARY subscriptions receive consolidated status
 * updates rather than individual processing events, significantly reducing
 * bandwidth usage for monitoring applications.
 *
 * Multi-Client Support:
 * --------------------
 * Different clients can subscribe to different event types simultaneously:
 * - Debugging clients: DEBUGGER + DETAIL for comprehensive debugging
 * - Monitoring dashboards: SUMMARY for efficient status tracking
 * - Administrative tools: ALL for complete system visibility
 * - Log viewers: OUTPUT for message monitoring
 * - Pipeline managers: FLOW + TASK for execution tracking
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Subscribe to debugging and detail events
 * const subscription = EVENT_TYPE.DEBUGGER | EVENT_TYPE.DETAIL;
 *
 * // Check if client wants specific events
 * if (clientSubscription & EVENT_TYPE.SUMMARY) {
 *     sendSummaryUpdate(client, taskStatus);
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * DAP event for task lifecycle management with discriminated union for type safety.
 *
 * This event handles three distinct task lifecycle scenarios using TypeScript's
 * discriminated unions to provide strict type safety and prevent invalid field
 * combinations. Each action type has its own required fields and structure.
 *
 * Action Types:
 * - 'running': Lists all currently running tasks for the client's API key
 * - 'begin': Notifies that a new task has started execution
 * - 'end': Notifies that a task has completed or terminated
 *
 * Event Flow:
 * 1. Client subscribes to EVENT_TYPE.TASK
 * 2. Server immediately sends 'running' action with current task list
 * 3. As tasks start/stop, server sends 'begin'/'end' actions
 *
 * Network Optimization:
 * - 'running' action sent only once per subscription to provide initial state
 * - 'begin'/'end' actions sent as lightweight notifications
 * - Only tasks belonging to client's API key are included
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * function handleTaskEvent(event: { body: TaskEvent }): void {
 *     if (event.body.action === 'running') {
 *         console.log(`Found ${event.body.tasks.length} running tasks`);
 *         event.body.tasks.forEach(task => {
 *             console.log(`Task ${task.id} in project ${task.projectId}`);
 *         });
 *     } else {
 *         console.log(`Task ${event.body.name} has ${event.body.action}`);
 *         console.log(`Project: ${event.body.projectId}, Source: ${event.body.source}`);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
