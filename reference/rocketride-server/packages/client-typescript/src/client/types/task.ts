/**
 * Task lifecycle state enumeration for comprehensive state management.
 *
 * This enumeration defines all possible states in the task execution lifecycle,
 * providing clear state transitions and enabling proper resource management,
 * error handling, and client notification. Each state represents a distinct
 * phase with specific characteristics and available operations.
 *
 * Lifecycle Phases:
 * ----------------
 * NONE: Initial state before any resources are allocated or configuration
 *       is processed. Tasks in this state can be safely discarded without
 *       cleanup operations.
 *
 * STARTING: Resource allocation and initial setup phase. Ports are allocated,
 *           temporary files created, and subprocess preparation occurs.
 *
 * INITIALIZING: Subprocess has been created and is performing pipeline
 *               initialization. Service interfaces are being established.
 *
 * RUNNING: Task is operational and processing requests. All interfaces
 *          are available and the pipeline is actively executing.
 *
 * STOPPING: Graceful shutdown initiated. Subprocess is being terminated
 *           and resources are being cleaned up.
 *
 * COMPLETED: Task finished successfully. All resources cleaned up and
 *            final status available for client queries.
 *
 * CANCELLED: Task was terminated before completion. Resources cleaned up
 *            and termination reason available in status.
 *
 * State Transitions:
 * -----------------
 * Normal execution flow:
 * NONE → STARTING → INITIALIZING → RUNNING → STOPPING → COMPLETED
 *
 * Cancellation flow:
 * Any state → STOPPING → CANCELLED
 *
 * Error handling:
 * Any state → STOPPING → COMPLETED (with error exit code)
 *
 * Resource Management:
 * -------------------
 * - NONE/COMPLETED/CANCELLED: No active resources requiring cleanup
 * - STARTING/INITIALIZING/RUNNING: Active resources requiring cleanup
 * - STOPPING: Cleanup in progress, resources being deallocated
 *
 * Client Operations:
 * -----------------
 * - NONE: Configuration and launch operations available
 * - STARTING/INITIALIZING: Status monitoring available
 * - RUNNING: Full debugging and data processing operations available
 * - STOPPING: Limited status monitoring, operations being rejected
 * - COMPLETED/CANCELLED: Status queries only, task cleanup may be initiated
 *
 * Wait Operations:
 * ---------------
 * Clients can wait for specific state transitions using wait_for_running()
 * and similar methods. State transitions trigger event notifications to
 * all subscribed monitoring clients.

/**
 * Pipeline component execution flow tracking and visualization model.
 *
 * This model provides detailed tracking of pipeline component execution flow,
 * enabling real-time visualization of which components are currently executing
 * in each pipeline instance. It supports complex pipeline architectures with
 * multiple concurrent execution paths and nested component hierarchies.
 *
 * Flow Tracking Features:
 * ----------------------
 * - Multi-pipeline execution tracking with per-instance component stacks
 * - Real-time component entry/exit monitoring for performance analysis
 * - Visual pipeline flow representation for debugging and monitoring
 * - Component execution depth tracking for nested pipeline architectures
 * - Concurrent execution visibility across multiple pipeline instances
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * --------------
 * totalPipes: Total number of concurrent pipeline execution instances
 * byPipe: Dictionary mapping pipeline instance IDs to component execution stacks
 *
 * Component Stack Behavior:
 * ------------------------
 * Each pipeline instance maintains a stack of currently executing components:
 * - Component entry pushes component name onto the stack
 * - Component exit pops component name from the stack
 * - Stack depth indicates nesting level of component execution
 * - Empty stack indicates pipeline instance is idle or completed
 *
 * Visualization Applications:
 * --------------------------
 * - Real-time pipeline execution diagrams showing active components
 * - Performance analysis identifying bottlenecks and execution patterns
 * - Debugging support for component-level execution tracing
 * - Monitoring dashboards displaying pipeline health and activity
 *
 * Concurrent Execution Support:
 * ----------------------------
 * Multiple pipeline instances can execute simultaneously, each maintaining
 * independent component execution stacks. This enables complex parallel
 * processing scenarios with full visibility into each execution path.
 *
 * Example Flow Tracking:
 * ---------------------
 * Pipeline 0: ['source', 'transform', 'filter'] - Currently in filter component
 * Pipeline 1: ['source', 'transform']           - Currently in transform component
 * Pipeline 2: []                                - Idle or completed

/**
 * Comprehensive task status model with real-time processing statistics and metrics.
 *
 * This model provides complete task execution status including processing statistics,
 * error tracking, performance metrics, resource usage, and operational state.
 * It serves as the central status repository for task monitoring, client updates,
 * and administrative dashboards.
 *
 * Status Categories:
 * -----------------
 * - Job Information: Basic task identification and lifecycle status
 * - Processing Statistics: Counts, sizes, rates, and completion metrics
 * - Error Management: Error and warning tracking with message history
 * - Resource Monitoring: Service health and operational state
 * - Performance Metrics: Processing rates and resource utilization
 * - Pipeline Tracking: Component execution flow and pipeline visualization
 *
 * Real-Time Updates:
 * -----------------
 * Status is updated in real-time as the task processes data and progresses
 * through its lifecycle. Updates are broadcast to subscribed clients based
 * on their EVENT_TYPE subscriptions, enabling responsive monitoring and
 * debugging interfaces.
 *
 * Buffer Management:
 * -----------------
 * Error and warning lists maintain recent message history with automatic
 * buffer limits to prevent memory growth in long-running tasks. Trace
 * buffers preserve debugging information while controlling resource usage.
 *
 * Metrics Integration:
 * -------------------
 * Processing statistics and performance metrics are continuously updated
 * to provide real-time visibility into task performance, throughput,
 * and resource utilization patterns.
 *
 * Client Integration:
 * ------------------
 * Status information is serialized and broadcast to monitoring clients,
 * debugging interfaces, and administrative dashboards. Different client
 * types receive filtered status updates based on their subscription preferences.
