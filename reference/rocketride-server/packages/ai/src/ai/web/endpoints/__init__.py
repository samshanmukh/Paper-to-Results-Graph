Standard Endpoint Handlers Package.

This package collects the built-in HTTP endpoint handlers that every AI service
instance registers automatically. Importing from this package gives the server
module a single, consistent import point for all standard routes.

Endpoints provided:
    use          — POST /use: dynamically load a service module at runtime
    ping         — GET  /ping: lightweight liveness probe (public, no auth)
    version      — GET  /version: return build/package version (public, no auth)
    shutdown     — POST /shutdown: gracefully stop the server process
    status       — GET  /status: return aggregated server health and metrics
    auth_callback — GET /auth/callback: OAuth PKCE safety-net redirect handler
    vscode_oauth_bounce — GET /auth/vscode/google: forward the user-OAuth
        broker's redirect (tokens/state) to the VS Code extension deep link
"""

# Import each handler from its own sibling module so callers can do:
#   from ai.web.endpoints import ping, version, ...
from .use import use
from .ping import ping
from .version import version
from .shutdown import shutdown
from .status import status
from .auth_callback import auth_callback
from .vscode_oauth_bounce import vscode_oauth_bounce

__all__ = ['use', 'ping', 'version', 'shutdown', 'status', 'auth_callback', 'vscode_oauth_bounce']
