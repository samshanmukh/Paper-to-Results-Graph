"""
FileStore - General-purpose binary file system interface for RocketRide.

Provides directory-like semantics (read, write, delete, list_dir, mkdir, stat)
over the flat key-value IStore backends (Filesystem, S3, Azure). Each FileStore
instance is scoped to a single account via client_id.

Supports handle-based I/O for streaming reads and writes:
    handle = await fs.open_write(path, connection_id)
    await fs.write_chunk(handle, chunk1)
    await fs.write_chunk(handle, chunk2)
    await fs.close_write(handle)

Usage:
    from ai.account.store import Store

    store = Store.create()
    fs = store.get_file_store(client_id='user-123')

    await fs.write('data/input.csv', b'col1,col2\\n1,2\\n', connection_id=1)
    data = await fs.read('data/input.csv', connection_id=1)
    entries = await fs.list_dir('data/')
