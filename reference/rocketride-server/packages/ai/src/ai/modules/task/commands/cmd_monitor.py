MonitorCommands: DAP Event Monitoring and Subscription System.

This module implements a real-time event monitoring system for computational tasks
within a distributed debugging and execution environment. It manages event subscriptions
and forwards task-related events to interested DAP clients based on their monitoring
preferences and access permissions.

Primary Responsibilities:
--------------------------
1. Manages event subscriptions for task monitoring clients
2. Routes task events to subscribed monitors based on event types and access controls
3. Provides selective event filtering (passive, active, debug-only, or none)
4. Maintains monitor registrations with apikey-based access control
5. Handles real-time status updates and task state changes
6. Integrates with the DAP protocol for standardized event communication

Event Types Supported:
----------------------
- PASSIVE: General task status and lifecycle events
- ACTIVE: Interactive events requiring client response
- DEBUG: Debugging-specific events (breakpoints, variable changes, etc.)
- ALL: Subscribe to all event types
- NONE: Unsubscribe from all events

Architecture:
-------------
This system enables multiple clients to monitor the same task simultaneously
with different event subscription levels. It acts as an event distribution
hub that respects access permissions and client preferences.

    DAP-based event monitoring and subscription manager for task events.

    This class handles event subscriptions from DAP clients and manages the

    - Multi-client event subscription management

        This is the main entry point for clients to configure their event monitoring
        preferences. It processes the monitoring request, updates subscriptions,
        and optionally sends an immediate status update for active tasks.

            request (Dict[str, Any]): DAP monitor request containing:

            clients sending unknown type names do not cause a hard failure.
