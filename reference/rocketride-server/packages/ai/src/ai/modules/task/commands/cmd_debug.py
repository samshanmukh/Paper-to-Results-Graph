TaskCommands: DAP Command Handler for Task Management.

This module implements a Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) command handler that manages
the lifecycle of computational tasks within a distributed debugging/execution system.
It serves as the command interface layer that processes DAP messages to control
task execution, debugging sessions, and resource management.

Primary Responsibilities:
--------------------------
1. Handles DAP protocol commands for task lifecycle management (launch, execute, attach, terminate)
2. Manages debugging session initialization and capabilities negotiation
3. Provides task execution control (pause, continue, disconnect)
4. Coordinates with a TaskServer to orchestrate backend task engines
5. Maintains DAP-compliant communication with debugging clients

Architecture:
-------------
- Inherits from DAPConn to leverage DAP protocol handling
- Works in conjunction with TaskServer for actual task management
- Supports both debugging-enabled ('launch') and debug-free ('execute') task execution
- Handles attachment to existing task sessions for collaborative debugging

Usage Context:
--------------
This is designed for integration with FastAPI applications and serves as the
command processing layer in a task execution and debugging infrastructure.
The actual task execution and management is delegated to the TaskServer.
