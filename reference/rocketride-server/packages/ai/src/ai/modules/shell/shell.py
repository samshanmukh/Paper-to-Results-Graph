Shell static file handler.

Serves the shell-ui web application (Module Federation host) from
``dist/server/static/shell/`` and MF remote app bundles from
``dist/server/static/apps/``.

Directory layout:
  - ``static/shell/index.html``              — SPA entry point
  - ``static/shell/static/``                 — JS/CSS bundles
  - ``static/shell/themes/``                 — theme JSON files
  - ``static/shell/favicon.svg``             — favicon
  - ``static/apps/<app>/``                   — MF remote app bundles

Routes:
  GET /                    — shell SPA entry point
  GET /shell/{file_path}   — shell assets (JS, CSS, themes)
  GET /apps/{file_path}    — MF remote app bundles
