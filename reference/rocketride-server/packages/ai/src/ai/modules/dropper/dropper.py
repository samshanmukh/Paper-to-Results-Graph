    Serve static files for the dropper interface with authentication.

    This function handles serving static files for a Single Page Application (SPA)
    dropper interface. It includes authentication via cookies or query parameters,
    path traversal security checks, and fallback behavior for SPA routing.

    Authentication flow:
    1. Check for 'apikey' and 'token' in cookies - if present, serve the file
    2. If not in cookies, check query parameters and redirect with cookies set
    3. If neither present, return 401 Unauthorized

    Args:
        request (Request): The incoming HTTP request object containing path parameters,
                          cookies, and query parameters.

    Returns:
        FileResponse: The requested static file or index.html fallback
        RedirectResponse: Redirect to /chat with authentication cookies set
        HTTPException: 401 Unauthorized if authentication credentials missing

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 401 status when apikey and token are not provided
