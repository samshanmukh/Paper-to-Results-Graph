"""
DataConnection: DAP-based data pipeline connection handler.

This module implements a DAP connection handler for data pipeline operations.
It extends DAPConn to provide data-specific command handling and pipeline
integration while maintaining the standard DAP protocol interface.

Primary Responsibilities:
--------------------------
1. Handle DAP commands for data pipeline operations
2. Route commands to appropriate data server operations
3. Manage connection lifecycle for data clients
4. Provide authentication and token-based operation correlation
5. Handle data-specific extended commands
6. Monitor and forward data operation events

The connection serves as a bridge between DAP clients and backend data
processing operations, enabling remote data pipeline control and monitoring.
