Echo Pipeline Configuration for Testing.

This module provides a simple echo pipeline configuration used for testing
data flow through the RocketRide pipeline system.

Usage:
    from echo_pipeline import get_echo_pipeline

    pipeline = get_echo_pipeline()
    token = await client.use(pipeline)
"""

from typing import Dict, Any


def get_echo_pipeline(project_id: str = 'e612b741-748c-4b35-a8b7-186797a8ea42') -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get the echo pipeline configuration.

    This pipeline receives data and returns it unchanged, making it ideal
    for testing basic connectivity and data transmission.

    Args:
        project_id: Unique project identifier. Concurrent pipelines must use
            distinct project_ids to avoid server-side contention during startup.

    Returns:
        Echo pipeline configuration.
