Real-time Upload Progress Monitor for RocketRide File Uploads.

This module provides the UploadProgressMonitor class for comprehensive monitoring
and display of file upload operations with progress tracking, statistics, error
handling, and dynamic layout management. Use this monitor to track upload progress,
view real-time statistics, monitor errors and completion status, and maintain
visibility into file transfer operations.

The upload monitor creates organized displays showing active uploads with progress
bars, completed files, failed uploads with error messages, and overall upload
statistics with automatic space management and visual formatting.

Key Features:
    - Real-time upload progress tracking with visual progress bars
    - Dynamic display layout adapting to terminal size
    - Comprehensive upload statistics and throughput calculations
    - Error tracking and detailed failure reporting
    - File validation error display with user-friendly formatting
    - Final results summary with timing and performance data

Usage:
    monitor = UploadProgressMonitor(cli)
    monitor.set_total_files(file_count)
    monitor.display_status(upload_event)
