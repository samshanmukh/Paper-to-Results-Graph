RocketRide CLI Task Events Monitoring Command Implementation.

This module provides the EventsCommand class for monitoring all task events with
configurable event type filtering through the RocketRide CLI. Use this command to
monitor real-time events, debug task execution, analyze processing flows, and
track detailed task behavior with comprehensive event logging and display.

The events command provides live monitoring of all task events with timestamp
tracking, event filtering, scrollable history, detailed event data display,
and optional file logging for debugging and analysis purposes with automatic
reconnection handling.

Key Features:
    - Real-time event monitoring with live updates and timestamps
    - Configurable event type filtering (DETAIL, SUMMARY, OUTPUT, etc.)
    - Optional file logging for persistent event storage and analysis
    - Scrollable event history with automatic pruning
    - Detailed event data display with structured formatting
    - Automatic reconnection handling for network interruptions
    - Event correlation and indexing for analysis
    - Comprehensive error handling and graceful recovery

Usage:
    rocketride events SUMMARY,OUTPUT --token <task_token> --apikey <key>
    rocketride events ALL --token <task_token> --apikey <key> --log events.log
    rocketride events DETAIL --token <task_token> --apikey <key> --log /path/to/events.json
