Configuration Loading Utilities for RocketRide Pipeline Files.

This module provides utilities for loading and parsing RocketRide pipeline
configuration files with support for both JSON and JSON5 formats. Use these
functions to load pipeline configurations with comprehensive error handling,
format validation, and clear error reporting for configuration issues.

The configuration loader handles multiple JSON formats, provides detailed
error messages for parsing failures, and ensures robust file access with
proper exception handling for missing files and permission issues.

Key Features:
    - Support for both standard JSON and JSON5 formats
    - Comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages
    - File access validation with clear error reporting
    - Graceful fallback from JSON5 to JSON when library unavailable
    - UTF-8 encoding support for international character sets

Usage:
    config = load_pipeline_config("my_pipeline.json")

    load_pipeline_config: Main function for loading pipeline configurations

    Load pipeline configuration from a .pipeline file.

    Reads and parses a pipeline configuration file supporting both JSON
    and JSON5 formats with comprehensive error handling and validation.

    Args:
        pipeline_file: Path to the pipeline configuration file

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Parsed pipeline configuration dictionary

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified pipeline file doesn't exist
        ValueError: If the file format is invalid or parsing fails

    Supported Formats:
        - JSON5 (if json5 library is available) - allows comments, trailing commas
        - Standard JSON - strict JSON format compliance
        - UTF-8 encoding for international character support

    Error Handling:
        - File existence validation with clear error messages
        - Format-specific parsing with detailed error information
        - Fallback from JSON5 to JSON if library unavailable
        - Comprehensive exception handling for file access issues

    Usage:
        ```python
        try:
            config = load_pipeline_config('my_pipeline.json')
            # Use configuration for pipeline setup
