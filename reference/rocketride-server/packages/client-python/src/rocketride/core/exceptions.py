Custom Exception Classes for RocketRide Operations.

This module provides specialized exception classes for different types of errors
that can occur when working with RocketRide. These exceptions provide better error
context and make it easier to handle different failure scenarios appropriately.

The exception hierarchy helps you:
- Distinguish between different types of failures
- Access detailed error information from the server
- Handle errors at the appropriate level of specificity
- Debug issues with comprehensive error context

Usage:
    from rocketride.exceptions import ConnectionException, PipeException

    try:
        await client.connect()
        result = await client.send(token, data)
    except ConnectionException as e:
        print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
        # Handle connection-specific errors
    except PipeException as e:
        print(f"Data pipe error: {e}")
        # Handle data transfer errors
    except RocketRideException as e:
        print(f"General RocketRide error: {e}")
        # Handle any other RocketRide errors
"""

from typing import Any, Dict


class DAPException(Exception):
    """
    Base exception class for Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) errors.

    This exception wraps DAP error responses to provide structured access to
    error information including file locations, line numbers, and other
    contextual data returned by RocketRide servers.

    The class preserves the complete DAP result dictionary while extracting
    the error message for standard exception handling patterns.

    Attributes:
        dap_result: Complete DAP result dictionary containing detailed error
                   information and context from the server

    Example:
        try:
            result = await client.some_operation()
            if client.did_fail(result):
                raise DAPException(result)
        except DAPException as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")

            # Access detailed error context
            if 'file' in e.dap_result and 'line' in e.dap_result:
                print(f"Location: {e.dap_result['file']}:{e.dap_result['line']}")

            # Access full error context
            print(f"Full details: {e.dap_result}")
    """

    def __init__(self, dap_result: Dict[str, Any]):
        """
        Initialize DAPException with a DAP result dictionary.

        Args:
            dap_result: DAP response dictionary containing error information.
                       Expected to have a 'message' field with the error description,
                       and may include additional context like 'file', 'line', etc.
        """
        # Extract error message for the base exception
        error_message = dap_result.get('message', 'Unknown DAP error')
        super().__init__(error_message)

        # Store complete DAP result for detailed error analysis
        self.dap_result = dap_result or {}


class RocketRideException(DAPException):
    """
    Base exception for all RocketRide operations.

    This is the root exception class for all RocketRide-specific errors.
    Catch this exception type to handle any error that originates from
    RocketRide operations while still having access to detailed error context.

    Example:
        client = RocketRideClient(uri)
        try:

    """

    pass


class ConnectionException(RocketRideException):
    """
    Exception raised for connection-related issues.

    Raised when there are problems connecting to RocketRide servers,
    maintaining connections, or when connections are lost unexpectedly.

    Common scenarios:
    - Server is unreachable or offline
    - Network connectivity issues
    - Authentication failures
    - WebSocket connection problems
    - Connection timeouts

    Example:
        try:

        except ConnectionException as e:

class AuthenticationException(ConnectionException):
    """Raised when authentication fails (bad API key or credentials)."""

    pass


class PipeException(RocketRideException, RuntimeError):
    """
    Exception raised for data pipe operations.

    Raised when there are problems with data pipes used for sending
    data to pipelines, uploading files, or streaming operations.

    Note:
        Also inherits from :class:`RuntimeError` for backward compatibility with
        callers that previously caught ``RuntimeError`` from
        ``client.send()`` / ``client.pipe()`` / pipe ``open()``/``write()``/``close()``.

    Common scenarios:
    - Failed to open data pipe
    - Error writing data to pipe
    - Pipe closed unexpectedly
    - Data format or size issues
    - Server-side processing errors

    Example:
        try:
            pipe = await client.pipe(token, mimetype="text/csv")
            await pipe.open()
            await pipe.write(csv_data)

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Unexpected pipe error: {e}")
    """

    pass


class ExecutionException(RocketRideException):
    """
    Exception raised for pipeline execution issues.

    Raised when there are problems starting, running, or managing
    RocketRide pipelines and processing tasks.

    Common scenarios:
    - Pipeline configuration errors
    - Failed to start pipeline
    - Pipeline crashed during execution
    - Resource allocation problems
    - Invalid pipeline parameters

    Example:
        try:

    """

    pass


class ValidationException(RocketRideException):
    """
    Exception raised for input validation failures.

    Raised when input data, configurations, or parameters don't meet
    the requirements for RocketRide operations.

    Common scenarios:
    - Invalid file paths or missing files
    - Malformed configuration data
    - Invalid API keys or tokens
    - Unsupported data formats
    - Parameter value out of range

    Example:
        try:

            result = await client.use(filepath="nonexistent.json")
