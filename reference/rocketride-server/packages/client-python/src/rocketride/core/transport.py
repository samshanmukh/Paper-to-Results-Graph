Transport Base Classes for DAP Protocol Communication.

This module provides abstract base classes for implementing different transport
mechanisms in Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) implementations. Transport classes
handle the actual network communication between clients and servers.

The transport layer is responsible for:
- Establishing and maintaining network connections
- Serializing and deserializing messages
- Handling connection events and errors
- Providing consistent interfaces across different protocols

This is an internal implementation detail used by the RocketRide client to
communicate with servers. Most users won't interact with these classes
directly - they're part of the underlying communication infrastructure.

Key Features:
- Abstract base class defining standard transport interface
- Connection lifecycle management with callbacks
- Message handling with debugging support
- Support for both client and server connection patterns
- Extensible design for different transport types (WebSocket, TCP, etc.)

    Abstract base class for DAP transport implementations.

    This class defines the standard interface that all transport implementations
    must follow for DAP communication. It provides common functionality for
    callback management and connection state tracking while requiring concrete
    implementations to handle transport-specific details.

    Transport implementations handle the actual network communication including:
    - Connection establishment and management
    - Message serialization and transmission
    - Error handling and recovery
    - Connection lifecycle events

    This ensures a consistent API across different transport types while allowing
    each implementation to optimize for its specific protocol requirements.
