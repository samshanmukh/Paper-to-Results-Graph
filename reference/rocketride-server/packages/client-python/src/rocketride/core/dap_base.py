Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) Base Mixin Classes.

This module provides the foundational DAPBase mixin class for building Debug Adapter Protocol
components. Use this module when creating DAP servers, clients, transports, or protocol handlers
that need standardized logging, error handling, and message construction capabilities.

The module implements the core DAP message lifecycle including request/response correlation,
event generation, error handling with traceback information, and two-level debug output for
both operational and protocol-level debugging.

Key Components:
    DAPBase: Base mixin class providing DAP functionality

Usage:
    from dap_base import DAPBase

    class MyDAPServer(DAPBase):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(module="MyServer")

Features:
    - Automatic sequence number generation for message correlation
    - Two-level debug output (general messages and protocol details)
    - Standardized DAP message builders (requests, responses, events, errors)
    - Exception handling with traceback information
    - Transport binding for network communication
    - Configurable logging integration

    Mixin class providing standardized logging and error handling for DAP components.

    This class serves as a base mixin for all DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) related
    components, providing consistent logging, error handling, and debugging capabilities.
    It centralizes common functionality needed across different DAP implementations
    including servers, clients, transports, and protocol handlers.

    Key Features:
        - Standardized error logging and exception raising
        - Hierarchical debug message levels (general vs protocol-specific)
        - Configurable message type prefixes for multi-instance debugging
        - Consistent formatting across all DAP components
        - Support for exception chaining to preserve error context
        - Request/response correlation system for async operations
        - Message building utilities following DAP specification

    Usage:
        This class is designed to be used as a mixin with other DAP classes:

    Debug Levels:
        - DebugOut: General operational messages (connections, state changes)
        - DebugProtocol: Detailed protocol messages (raw DAP packets, wire format)

    Attributes:
        _msg_type (str): Message type identifier used in log prefixes to distinguish
