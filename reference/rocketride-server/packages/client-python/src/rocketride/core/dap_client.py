Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) Client Implementation.

This module provides the DAP client implementation that handles communication
with RocketRide servers using the Debug Adapter Protocol. It manages connection
lifecycle, request/response correlation, and message handling.

This is an internal implementation detail that supports the higher-level
RocketRide client functionality. Most users won't need to interact with this
directly - it's used internally by RocketRideClient for server communication.

Key Features:
- WebSocket-based communication with servers
- Request/response correlation using sequence numbers
- Connection lifecycle management
- Message serialization and deserialization
- Error handling and recovery

    DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) client for communicating with RocketRide servers.

    This class implements the client side of the DAP communication protocol,

    It provides the underlying communication infrastructure used by the
    higher-level RocketRide client functionality.

    Key Responsibilities:
    - Establishing and maintaining connections to DAP servers
    - Correlating requests with their responses using sequence numbers
    - Handling connection events and state changes
    - Managing the message sending and receiving lifecycle
    - Providing error handling and recovery mechanisms
