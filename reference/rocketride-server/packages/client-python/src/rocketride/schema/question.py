AI Question and Chat System for RocketRide.

This module provides classes for asking questions to RocketRide's AI, managing chat conversations,
and handling both text and structured JSON responses. Use these classes to build intelligent
applications that can query your documents and data.

Basic Usage:
    from rocketride.schema import Question, DocFilter

    # Simple question
    question = Question()
    question.addQuestion("What are the key findings in the research papers?")
    response = await client.chat(token="chat_token", question=question)

    # Structured JSON response
    question = Question(expectJson=True)
    question.addQuestion("Extract the sales figures by quarter")
    question.addExample("Show Q1 sales", {"Q1": 100000, "Q2": 150000})
    response = await client.chat(token="chat_token", question=question)

Advanced Usage:
    # Question with context and examples
    question = Question()
    question.addInstruction("Analysis", "Focus on financial metrics and trends")
    question.addExample("Revenue analysis", "Total revenue increased 15% year-over-year")
    question.addContext("This is quarterly financial data from 2024")
    question.addQuestion("What were the main revenue drivers?")
