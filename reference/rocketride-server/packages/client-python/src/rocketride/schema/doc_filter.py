Document Filtering and Search Controls.

This module provides the DocFilter class for controlling search behavior, pagination,
and result processing in RocketRide operations. Use filters to refine your searches,
control how documents are grouped, and configure AI chat behavior.

Usage:
    from rocketride.schema import DocFilter, Question

    # Basic search with pagination
    filter = DocFilter(limit=50, offset=0)

    # Search only tables
    filter = DocFilter(isTable=True, limit=25)

    # Get complete documents instead of chunks
    filter = DocFilter(fullDocuments=True)

    # Use with questions/chat
    question = Question(filter=filter)
    question.addQuestion("What are the sales figures?")

    Controls how RocketRide searches, processes, and returns documents in your queries.

    Use DocFilter to customize search behavior, pagination, content grouping,
    and AI processing options. This gives you fine-grained control over what
    documents are returned and how they're processed.

    Common Use Cases:
    - Pagination: Control which results to return (offset/limit)
    - Content grouping: Get full documents vs individual chunks
    - File type filtering: Search only tables, exclude deleted files
    - Permission filtering: Respect access controls
    - AI enhancements: Enable reranking, follow-up questions, context

    Example:
        # Paginated search for tables only
        filter = DocFilter(
            isTable=True,      # Only return table data
            limit=20,          # Return up to 20 results
            offset=0,          # Start from beginning
            useQuickRank=True  # Use AI to improve relevance
        )

        # Get complete documents instead of chunks
        filter = DocFilter(
            fullDocuments=True,  # Combine all chunks from same file
            limit=10
        )
