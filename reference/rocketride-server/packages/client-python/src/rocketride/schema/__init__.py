Data Schema Definitions for RocketRide Client.

This module provides Pydantic model classes for structured data used in RocketRide operations:
    - Question models for AI chat and document analysis
    - Document models for providing context to AI
    - Filter and metadata models for document organization

These models ensure type safety, validate input data, and provide clear documentation
of the expected data structures for various RocketRide operations.

Question Models:
    Question: Main class for asking questions to RocketRide's AI
    QuestionType: Enum defining question types (TEXT or JSON)
    QuestionText: Individual question text with optional metadata
    QuestionExample: Example answers to guide AI response formatting
    QuestionHistory: Conversation history for contextual AI responses
    Answer: Structured response from AI containing answer and metadata

Document Models:
    Doc: Represents a document or text to provide as context
    DocGroup: Collection of related documents
    DocMetadata: Metadata attributes for documents
    DocFilter: Filtering criteria for document selection

Usage:
    from rocketride.schema import Question, Doc, DocFilter

    # Create a question with document context
    question = Question()
    question.addQuestion('What are the main themes?')
    question.addDocument(Doc(page_content='Your text here'))

    # Use filtering to select specific documents
    filter = DocFilter(where={'category': 'financial'})
