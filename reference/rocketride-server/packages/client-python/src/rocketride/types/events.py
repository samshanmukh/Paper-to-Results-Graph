Event System for RocketRide DAP Communication.

This module defines the complete event system for Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) communication,
providing intelligent event filtering, multi-client support, and network optimization for
distributed computational pipeline systems.

Event Architecture:
    The event system enables selective event subscription with multiple categories,
    allowing clients to receive only relevant events based on their role and needs.
    This reduces network traffic and improves system performance in multi-client
    distributed environments.

Event Types:
    EVENT_TYPE: Flag enum for event subscription categories (DEBUGGER, DETAIL, SUMMARY, etc.)
    EVENT_STATUS_UPDATE: Task status updates with processing statistics
    EVENT_TASK: Task lifecycle management (running, begin, end)

Subscription Model:
    Clients can subscribe to specific event types using bitwise flag combinations:
    - DEBUGGER: Debug protocol events and breakpoints
    - DETAIL: Real-time processing events requiring immediate attention
    - SUMMARY: Periodic consolidated status updates for dashboards
    - OUTPUT: Standard output and logging messages
    - FLOW: Pipeline execution flow and component tracking
    - TASK: Task lifecycle events (start, stop, state changes)
    - ALL: Comprehensive monitoring for administrative tools
    - NONE: Unsubscribe from all events

Network Optimization:
    Event filtering significantly reduces network bandwidth by:
    - Sending only subscribed event types to each client
    - Consolidating frequent updates into periodic summaries (SUMMARY vs DETAIL)
    - Eliminating redundant event delivery to uninterested clients
    - Supporting efficient multi-client scenarios with different monitoring needs

Usage:
    from rocketride.types import EVENT_TYPE, EVENT_STATUS_UPDATE, EVENT_TASK

    # Subscribe to specific event types
    async def on_event(event):
        if event['event'] == 'apaevt_status_update':
            status = event['body']
            print(f"Task status: {status['state']}")
        elif event['event'] == 'apaevt_task':
            action = event['body']['action']
            print(f"Task {action}")

    # Configure client with event subscription
    client = RocketRideClient(
        auth='your_api_key',
        onEvent=on_event
    )

    # Subscribe to monitoring events
    subscription = EVENT_TYPE.SUMMARY | EVENT_TYPE.TASK
    await client.subscribe(subscription)

class EVENT_TYPE(Flag):
    """
    Event type enumeration for sophisticated client subscription and event routing.

    This enumeration defines event categories used for intelligent event filtering
    and routing in multi-client environments. It enables clients to subscribe
    to specific types of events based on their needs and capabilities, reducing
    network traffic and improving system performance.

    Event Categories:
    ----------------
    NONE: Unsubscribe from all events (cleanup and disconnection)
    ALL: Subscribe to all events regardless of category (comprehensive monitoring)
    DEBUGGER: Debug-specific events for debugging protocol communication
    DETAIL: Real-time processing events requiring immediate client attention
    SUMMARY: Periodic status summaries suitable for dashboard monitoring
    OUTPUT: Standard output and logging messages
    FLOW: Pipeline flow events - component execution tracking
    TASK: Task lifecycle events - start, stop, state changes

    Subscription Strategies:
    -----------------------
    NONE: Used during client disconnection to stop all event delivery
          and perform cleanup of monitoring subscriptions.

    ALL: Comprehensive monitoring for administrative clients that need
         complete visibility into task execution and debugging activities.

    DEBUGGER: Debug protocol events including breakpoint hits, variable
              changes, stack traces, and debugging session management.

    DETAIL: Real-time processing events including object processing updates,
            error/warning messages, metrics updates, and immediate status
            changes requiring client response or display updates.

    SUMMARY: Periodic status summaries sent at CONST_STATUS_UPDATE_FREQ
             intervals containing complete task status, suitable for
             monitoring dashboards and periodic client updates.

    OUTPUT: Standard output and logging messages from task execution.

    FLOW: Pipeline flow events tracking component execution, data flow
          between pipeline stages, and processing pipeline status.

    TASK: Task lifecycle events including task start, stop, pause, resume,
          and state changes for task management interfaces.

    Network Optimization:
    --------------------
    Event filtering reduces network traffic by sending only relevant events
    to interested clients. SUMMARY subscriptions receive consolidated status
    updates rather than individual processing events, significantly reducing
    bandwidth usage for monitoring applications.

    Multi-Client Support:
    --------------------
    Different clients can subscribe to different event types simultaneously:
    - Debugging clients: DEBUGGER + DETAIL for comprehensive debugging
    - Monitoring dashboards: SUMMARY for efficient status tracking
    - Administrative tools: ALL for complete system visibility
    - Log viewers: OUTPUT for message monitoring
    - Pipeline managers: FLOW + TASK for execution tracking

    Usage Examples:
    --------------
    # Subscribe to debugging and detail events
    subscription = EVENT_TYPE.DEBUGGER | EVENT_TYPE.DETAIL

    # Check if client wants specific events
    if client_subscription & EVENT_TYPE.SUMMARY:
        send_summary_update(client, task_status)

    # Check for multiple event types
    if client_subscription & (EVENT_TYPE.FLOW | EVENT_TYPE.TASK):
        send_pipeline_event(client, event)
