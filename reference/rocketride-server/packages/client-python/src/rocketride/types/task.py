Task Status and Lifecycle Management Types.

This module defines the complete type system for task lifecycle management, real-time status
monitoring, and event-driven communication in RocketRide's distributed pipeline processing system.
These types provide structured data models for tracking complex task execution states, processing
statistics, error management, and pipeline flow visualization.

Types Defined:
    TASK_STATE: Enumeration of task lifecycle states
    TASK_STATUS_FLOW: Pipeline component execution flow tracking
    TASK_STATUS: Comprehensive task status with processing statistics

Task Lifecycle:
    Tasks progress through well-defined states from initialization through completion:

    NONE → STARTING → INITIALIZING → RUNNING → STOPPING → COMPLETED (success)
                                              → STOPPING → CANCELLED (termination)

    Each state transition triggers events to subscribed clients, enabling real-time
    monitoring and responsive user interfaces.

Status Tracking:
    The TASK_STATUS model provides comprehensive execution metrics including:
    - Processing counts and byte statistics
    - Real-time processing rates
    - Error and warning history
    - Resource utilization metrics
    - Pipeline component execution flow
    - Service health status

Flow Visualization:
    The TASK_STATUS_FLOW model enables real-time visualization of pipeline execution,
    showing which components are actively executing in each pipeline instance. This
    supports debugging, performance analysis, and execution monitoring.

Usage:
    from rocketride.types import TASK_STATE, TASK_STATUS

    # Check task state
    async def monitor_task(client, token):
        status = await client.status(token)

        if status['state'] == TASK_STATE.RUNNING.value:
            print(f"Processing: {status['completedCount']}/{status['totalCount']}")
            print(f"Rate: {status['rateCount']} items/sec")
        elif status['state'] == TASK_STATE.COMPLETED.value:
            print(f"Completed with exit code: {status['exitCode']}")

        # Check for errors
        if status['errors']:
            for error in status['errors']:
                print(f"Error: {error}")

class TASK_STATE(Enum):
    """
    Task lifecycle state enumeration for comprehensive state management.

    This enumeration defines all possible states in the task execution lifecycle,
    providing clear state transitions and enabling proper resource management,
    error handling, and client notification. Each state represents a distinct
    phase with specific characteristics and available operations.

    Lifecycle Phases:
    ----------------
    NONE: Initial state before any resources are allocated or configuration
          is processed. Tasks in this state can be safely discarded without
          cleanup operations.

    STARTING: Resource allocation and initial setup phase. Ports are allocated,
              temporary files created, and subprocess preparation occurs.

    INITIALIZING: Subprocess has been created and is performing pipeline
                  initialization. Service interfaces are being established.

    RUNNING: Task is operational and processing requests. All interfaces
             are available and the pipeline is actively executing.

    STOPPING: Graceful shutdown initiated. Subprocess is being terminated
              and resources are being cleaned up.

    COMPLETED: Task finished successfully. All resources cleaned up and
               final status available for client queries.

    CANCELLED: Task was terminated before completion. Resources cleaned up
               and termination reason available in status.

    State Transitions:
    -----------------
    Normal execution flow:
    NONE → STARTING → INITIALIZING → RUNNING → STOPPING → COMPLETED

    Cancellation flow:
    Any state → STOPPING → CANCELLED

    Error handling:
    Any state → STOPPING → COMPLETED (with error exit code)

    Resource Management:
    -------------------
    - NONE/COMPLETED/CANCELLED: No active resources requiring cleanup
    - STARTING/INITIALIZING/RUNNING: Active resources requiring cleanup
    - STOPPING: Cleanup in progress, resources being deallocated

    Client Operations:
    -----------------
    - NONE: Configuration and launch operations available
    - STARTING/INITIALIZING: Status monitoring available
    - RUNNING: Full debugging and data processing operations available
    - STOPPING: Limited status monitoring, operations being rejected
    - COMPLETED/CANCELLED: Status queries only, task cleanup may be initiated

    Wait Operations:
    ---------------
    Clients can wait for specific state transitions using wait_for_running()
    and similar methods. State transitions trigger event notifications to
    all subscribed monitoring clients.

class TASK_STATUS_FLOW(BaseModel):
    """
    Pipeline component execution flow tracking and visualization model.

    This model provides detailed tracking of pipeline component execution flow,
    enabling real-time visualization of which components are currently executing
    in each pipeline instance. It supports complex pipeline architectures with
    multiple concurrent execution paths and nested component hierarchies.

    Flow Tracking Features:
    ----------------------
    - Multi-pipeline execution tracking with per-instance component stacks
    - Real-time component entry/exit monitoring for performance analysis
    - Visual pipeline flow representation for debugging and monitoring
    - Component execution depth tracking for nested pipeline architectures
    - Concurrent execution visibility across multiple pipeline instances

    Data Structure:
    --------------
    totalPipes: Total number of concurrent pipeline execution instances
    byPipe: Dictionary mapping pipeline instance IDs to component execution stacks

    Component Stack Behavior:
    ------------------------
    Each pipeline instance maintains a stack of currently executing components:
    - Component entry pushes component name onto the stack
    - Component exit pops component name from the stack
    - Stack depth indicates nesting level of component execution
    - Empty stack indicates pipeline instance is idle or completed

    Visualization Applications:
    --------------------------
    - Real-time pipeline execution diagrams showing active components
    - Performance analysis identifying bottlenecks and execution patterns
    - Debugging support for component-level execution tracing
    - Monitoring dashboards displaying pipeline health and activity

    Concurrent Execution Support:
    ----------------------------
    Multiple pipeline instances can execute simultaneously, each maintaining
    independent component execution stacks. This enables complex parallel
    processing scenarios with full visibility into each execution path.

    Example Flow Tracking:
    ---------------------
    Pipeline 0: ['source', 'transform', 'filter'] - Currently in filter component
    Pipeline 1: ['source', 'transform']           - Currently in transform component
    Pipeline 2: []                                - Idle or completed

class TASK_STATUS(BaseModel):
    """
    Comprehensive task status model with real-time processing statistics and metrics.

    This model provides complete task execution status including processing statistics,
    error tracking, performance metrics, resource usage, and operational state.
    It serves as the central status repository for task monitoring, client updates,
    and administrative dashboards.

    Status Categories:
    -----------------
    - Job Information: Basic task identification and lifecycle status
    - Processing Statistics: Counts, sizes, rates, and completion metrics
    - Error Management: Error and warning tracking with message history
    - Resource Monitoring: Service health and operational state
    - Performance Metrics: Processing rates and resource utilization
    - Pipeline Tracking: Component execution flow and pipeline visualization

    Real-Time Updates:
    -----------------
    Status is updated in real-time as the task processes data and progresses
    through its lifecycle. Updates are broadcast to subscribed clients based
    on their EVENT_TYPE subscriptions, enabling responsive monitoring and
    debugging interfaces.

    Buffer Management:
    -----------------
    Error and warning lists maintain recent message history with automatic
    buffer limits to prevent memory growth in long-running tasks. Trace
    buffers preserve debugging information while controlling resource usage.

    Metrics Integration:
    -------------------
    Processing statistics and performance metrics are continuously updated
    to provide real-time visibility into task performance, throughput,
    and resource utilization patterns.

    Client Integration:
    ------------------
    Status information is serialized and broadcast to monitoring clients,
    debugging interfaces, and administrative dashboards. Different client
    types receive filtered status updates based on their subscription preferences.
