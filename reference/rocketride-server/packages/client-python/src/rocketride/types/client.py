Client Type Definitions for RocketRide Client.

This module provides TypedDict classes and type aliases for type-safe client configuration,
DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) messages, and callback signatures. These types improve code
completion, enable static type checking, and document expected data structures.

Types Defined:
    DAPMessage: Core message structure for client-server communication
    TransportCallbacks: Callback hooks for transport layer events
    ConnectionInfo: Connection configuration for server endpoints
    RocketRideClientConfig: Complete client configuration options
    EventCallback: Type alias for event handling callbacks
    ConnectCallback: Type alias for connection callbacks
    ConnectErrorCallback: Type alias for connection attempt failure callbacks
    DisconnectCallback: Type alias for disconnection callbacks
    TraceInfo: Stack trace information for debugging errors

These types are compatible with Python 3.10+ using native typing without extensions.

Usage:
    from rocketride.types import RocketRideClientConfig, EventCallback

    # Type-safe configuration
    config: RocketRideClientConfig = {
        'auth': 'your_api_key',
        'uri': 'wss://server.example.com',
        'onEvent': my_event_handler
    }

    # Type hints for callbacks
    async def handle_event(event: DAPMessage) -> None:
        print(f"Event: {event['event']}")
