Account Type Definitions for the RocketRide Python SDK.

Data shapes for user profiles, API keys, organizations, teams, and members.
These mirror the server's DAP response shapes and the TypeScript SDK's
``types/account.ts`` definitions.

Types Defined:
    AccountProfile: The authenticated user's profile data.
    AccountOrganization: An organization entry nested inside AccountProfile.
    AccountOrgTeam: A team entry nested inside AccountOrganization.
    ApiKeyRecord: A single API key record returned from the server.
    OrgDetail: Summary information about an organization.
    MemberRecord: A single organization member record.
    TeamRecord: Summary of a team, used in the teams list view.
    TeamDetail: Full detail for a single team including its member list.
    TeamMemberRecord: A member record scoped to a specific team.
    ProfileUpdate: Mutable profile fields submitted when saving edits.
    CreateKeyParams: Parameters for creating a new API key.
    CreateKeyResult: Result containing the raw key string.
    InviteMemberParams: Parameters for inviting a new member.
    TeamMemberParams: Parameters for adding or updating a team member.
