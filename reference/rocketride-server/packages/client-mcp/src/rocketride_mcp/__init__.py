"""
RocketRide MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Package.

This package provides an MCP server implementation that wraps the RocketRide client,
exposing RocketRide data pipelines as dynamically-discovered MCP tools for AI assistants
and LLM integrations. The server connects to a RocketRide instance, retrieves available
pipeline tasks, and allows AI agents to send files through those pipelines for processing.

Primary responsibilities include:
- Wrapping RocketRideClient to provide MCP-compliant tool discovery and execution
- Dynamically exposing running RocketRide pipeline tasks as callable MCP tools
- Managing file upload and processing through RocketRide pipelines
- Providing built-in convenience tools for common document processing operations
- Exposing pipeline definitions, node schemas, and server status as MCP Resources
- Offering reusable MCP Prompt templates for common pipeline operations

Public modules:
- server: Contains run_server() and main() entry points for the MCP stdio server
- resources: MCP Resource handlers for pipelines, nodes, and server status
- prompts: MCP Prompt templates for document analysis, data chat, and evaluation
