## What it does

Source node that serves a web-based chat interface. Users open the chat URL in a browser, type questions, and each submission flows through the pipeline as a `questions` lane. Results are returned in the chat window.

After the pipeline starts, the Project Log displays the chat URL and public authorization key.

**Lanes:**

| Lane in | Lane out    | Description                                               |
| ------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| -       | `questions` | Each message submitted via the chat UI becomes a question |

## Configuration

None. The chat URL and authorization key are generated automatically when the pipeline starts.
