"""
RocketRide Wave — a wave-planning agent driver implementing AgentBase.

Execution model:
  1. Build the full planning prompt (system instructions, tool schemas,
     memory context, prior wave results, persistent scratch notes).
  2. **Wave-planning step** — call the LLM with all tool descriptions.
     The LLM replies with either:
       {"tool_calls": [{"tool": "...", "args": {...}}, ...], "scratch": "..."}
     or:
       {"done": true, "answer": "...", "scratch": "..."}
  3. Execute all tool calls in the wave in parallel via the host.
  4. Store results in memory, append structural summaries to wave history.
  5. Repeat from step 1 until done=true or max_waves is reached.
  6. If max_waves is reached without done=true, run a synthesis fallback
     that asks the LLM to produce a best-effort answer from everything gathered.

Token efficiency is achieved by:
  - Showing only structural summaries of prior results (not raw data) in context.
  - The LLM uses memory.peek to pull specific values on demand.
  - Scratch notes carry only what the LLM explicitly chooses to remember.
  - Completed result keys are evicted from memory and context via the remove field.
