"""
RocketRide Wave node — global (per-pipe) state and configuration.

IGlobal holds state that is created once when the pipeline starts and
shared across all instances (concurrent requests) on this node.  In the
Wave agent, that means the single RocketRideDriver instance which is
stateless across runs and safe to share.
