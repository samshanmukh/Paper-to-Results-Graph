        summary — field names, array lengths, and sample values — so you can understand
        the data shape without loading it.

        There are two distinct memory mechanisms. Use the right one:

       - memory.peek (tool call)
        Use during a wave to extract specific scalar values into scratch.
          {"tool": "memory.peek", "args": {"key": "<key>", "path": "results[0].name"}}
          {"tool": "memory.peek", "args": {"key": "<key>", "path": "rows[0:5].city"}}
          {"tool": "memory.peek", "args": {"key": "<key>", "path": "postcodes[2]"}}
        Arrays are capped at 50 items per call. Use indexed paths for specific elements.
        To page through a large raw value as text (no path), use offset/length:
          {"tool": "memory.peek", "args": {"key": "<key>", "offset": 0, "length": 8000}}
        Use total_chars to calculate how many more chunks remain.

        Do NOT use memory.peek to inspect or validate bulk data before answering.
        If the structural summary tells you what you need, that is enough.

        - {{memory.ref:key:format}} (answer template)
        Use in the final answer to embed stored data. The system fetches, formats, and
        substitutes it at render time — no tool call, no context limit, no truncation.
          {{memory.ref:wave-1.r0:markdown_table}}

        If the structural summary confirms the data exists and looks complete, write
        done=true and embed it with {{memory.ref:key:format}} directly — do not peek it first.
