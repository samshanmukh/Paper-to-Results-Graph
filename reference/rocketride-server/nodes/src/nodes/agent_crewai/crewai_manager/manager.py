CrewAI Manager driver — hierarchical multi-agent Crew.

Fans out `describe` to all connected `crewai` channel nodes (CrewSubagent
nodes), assembles each into a CrewAI Agent + Task, and kicks off a hierarchical
Crew with this node acting as the manager.

Inherits from `CrewBase` (and therefore from `AgentBase`) but deliberately has
no `describe()` method — managers cannot be used as sub-agents under another
Manager. Cross-Manager nesting is supported via `tool.run_agent` (the agent-as-
tool path), not via the `crewai` channel.
