Mock qdrant_client Module for Testing
=====================================

This module provides a mock implementation of the qdrant_client library for testing
RocketRide's vector store integration without requiring a real Qdrant server.

How Mock Injection Works:
-------------------------
1. The test framework sets ROCKETRIDE_MOCK environment variable to point to nodes/test/mocks/
2. When the EAAS server starts a pipeline subprocess (node.py), it inherits this env var
3. node.py detects ROCKETRIDE_MOCK and inserts that path at the FRONT of sys.path
4. When the qdrant node does `from qdrant_client import QdrantClient`, Python finds
   THIS mock module first (because sys.path is searched in order)
5. The real qdrant_client is never loaded - this mock completely shadows it

Key Design Principles:
----------------------
1. MIRROR THE REAL API: Export the same classes, functions, and submodules that the
   real library provides. The node code shouldn't need any changes to use the mock.

2. CLASS-LEVEL STATE: Use class variables (not instance variables) for storage so
   that data persists across multiple QdrantClient instances within the same process.
   This simulates a real database server that multiple clients can connect to.

3. PROPER SERIALIZATION: When storing Pydantic models or dataclasses, they must be
   serialized to dicts before returning from queries. Use model_dump(exclude_none=True)
   to avoid validation errors when the data is deserialized back into models.

4. FILTER THE SCHEMA DOC: The RocketRide store creates a hidden "schema" document with
   isDeleted=True to track vector size and model name. This should be filtered out
   from search results but included in scroll() when specifically requested.

Creating a New Mock:
--------------------
1. Create a directory: nodes/test/mocks/<library_name>/
2. Create __init__.py that exports all classes/functions the real library provides
3. Create submodule files (models.py, etc.) matching the real library structure
4. Implement the minimum API needed by the node being tested
5. Add comprehensive tests in the node's services.json "test" section

Usage:
------
The mock is automatically loaded when running tests via:
    builder nodes:test --pytest="-k <node_name>"

Or manually:
    set ROCKETRIDE_MOCK=C:\\Projects\\rocketride-server\\nodes\\test\\mocks
    python -m pytest nodes/test/test_dynamic.py -k qdrant -s -v

def _serialize_payload(payload: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:

    Serialize a payload dict containing Pydantic models or dataclasses to plain dicts.

    This is CRITICAL for proper mock operation. The RocketRide store code does:
        metadata = DocMetadata(**point.payload['meta'])

    If payload['meta'] is still a DocMetadata object (not a dict), this fails with:
        "argument after ** must be a mapping, not DocMetadata"

    Additionally, we must use exclude_none=True because DocMetadata has fields like:
        nodeId: str = Field(None, ...)

    The type annotation doesn't include Optional, so passing explicit None fails
    Pydantic validation. By excluding None values, we let the defaults apply.

class QdrantClient:
    """
    Mock implementation of the Qdrant vector database client.

    This mock stores all data in class-level dictionaries, simulating a database
    server that persists data across multiple client instances. This is important
    because the RocketRide store may create multiple QdrantClient instances during
    a single pipeline run (e.g., one for checking collection existence, another
    for actual operations).

    Storage Structure:
        _collections: {
            "ROCKETRIDE": {
                "vectors_config": VectorParams(...),
                "payload_schema": {"meta.nodeId": PayloadSchemaType.KEYWORD, ...}

                PointStruct(id="uuid2", vector=[0.2, ...], payload={...}),
            ]
        }

    Important Implementation Notes:
        1. The RocketRide store creates a "schema" document with isDeleted=True and
           objectId="schema" to track vector dimensions and embedding model.
           This must be returned by scroll() when filtered for, but excluded
           from query_points() search results.

        2. All payload objects must be serialized before returning to avoid
           "argument after ** must be a mapping" errors in the store code.

        3. Filter support is minimal - only the filters actually used by the
           RocketRide store are implemented (MatchAny for objectId filtering).
