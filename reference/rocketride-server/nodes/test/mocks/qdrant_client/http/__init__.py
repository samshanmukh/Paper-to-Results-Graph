Mock qdrant_client.http Module
==============================

This module provides a mock of the HTTP client module from qdrant_client.

In the real library, this module contains the HTTP-based client implementation
and various HTTP-specific models. The node code typically doesn't import
directly from this module, but it needs to exist because:

1. Some imports may reference it indirectly
2. The real qdrant_client.http module re-exports models for convenience

What to Mock:
-------------
If tests fail with ImportError mentioning qdrant_client.http, check:

1. What specific class/function is being imported
2. Whether it's already defined in our models.py
3. If so, just re-export it here from models

Adding HTTP-Specific Types:
---------------------------
The real http module has types like:
- ApiClient (the actual HTTP client)
- AsyncQdrantClient (async wrapper)
- Various API response models

Only add these if the node code actually uses them. Most nodes just use
the high-level QdrantClient which abstracts away the HTTP layer.
"""

# Re-export models for code that imports from qdrant_client.http
from .. import models as models

# If specific http-only types are needed, define them here:
# class SomeHttpOnlyType:
#     pass
