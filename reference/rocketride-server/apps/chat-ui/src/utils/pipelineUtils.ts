 * Extracts text responses from pipeline result

 * - Actual data is stored in fields identified by result_types
 * - Fields marked as "text" or "answers" contain displayable strings
 *
 * @param result - Pipeline result from RocketRide API
 * @returns Array of text strings ready for display
 * 
 * @example
 * // If result has: { result_types: { "answers": "answers" }, answers: ["Hello", "World"] }
 * // Returns: ["Hello", "World"]
