/**
 * Application Entry Point
 *
 * This is the main entry point for the RocketRide Chat application.
 * It initializes the React application and mounts it to the DOM.
 * 
 * Setup Process:
 * 1. Import React and ReactDOM
 * 2. Import root App component
 * 3. Import global styles
 * 4. Find root DOM element
 * 5. Create React root
 * 6. Render App in StrictMode
 * 
 * React StrictMode:
 * - Enables additional development checks
 * - Highlights potential problems
 * - Activates additional warnings
 * - Does not affect production builds
 * - May cause components to render twice in development
 * 
 * Error Handling:
 * - Throws if root element not found
 * - Prevents silent failure on missing DOM node
 * - Provides clear error message for debugging

 * - Enables concurrent rendering

 * - Transitions and suspense support
 * - Better error handling

 * Note: StrictMode only runs in development and has no impact
