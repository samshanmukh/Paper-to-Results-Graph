/**
 * icons.ts - Icon Constants for RocketRide VS Code Extension
 * 
 * This module provides a centralized collection of emoji-based icons used throughout
 * the VS Code extension for consistent visual feedback in logs, messages, and UI elements.
 * 
 * Using emojis as icons provides several benefits:
 * - Universal visual recognition across different VS Code themes
 * - No need for external icon files or SVG assets
 * - Consistent appearance across different operating systems
 * - Easy to identify different types of messages in logs and output channels
 * 
 * All icons are exported as a single object to enable easy importing and
 * prevent typos when referencing icon names throughout the codebase.
 */

/**
 * Centralized icon definitions using emoji characters
 * 
 * Each icon represents a specific state, action, or message type used throughout
 * the extension. The naming convention follows a descriptive approach where
 * the property name clearly indicates the intended use case.
 * 
 * Icon Categories:
 * - Status indicators: begin, end, success, error, warning
 * - Process states: loading, connecting, debug, launch, stop
 * - Communication: send, receive, message, question, help
 * - System types: python, pipeline
 * - Special states: exception (critical errors)
