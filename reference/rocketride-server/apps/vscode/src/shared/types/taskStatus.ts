/**
 * Task State Enumeration

 * NONE → STARTING → INITIALIZING → RUNNING → STOPPING → COMPLETED/CANCELLED
 * 
 * Visual Status Mapping:
 * - NONE, STARTING, COMPLETED, CANCELLED → "Offline" (inactive indicator)
 * - INITIALIZING → "Initializing" (inactive indicator)
 * - RUNNING → "Online" (active indicator)
 * - STOPPING → "Stopping" (warning indicator)
