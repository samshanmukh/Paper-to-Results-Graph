# Paper→Results Graph

**Turn research papers into executable evidence.**

Most research tools stop at summaries. Paper→Results closes the loop between what papers *claim* and what actually *runs*:

> **Paper → Claim → Method → Code → Sandbox Run → Result → Graph Update**

Select a method from a paper, generate a runnable implementation, execute it, and watch the result attach itself to the knowledge graph — `VALIDATES` or `REFUTES`, with logs, metrics, and failure data. The graph doesn't just know what papers say. It knows what has been tested.

Built for **HackwithBay 3.0** (July 7, 2026) — *Thoughtful Agents for Productivity*.

## The demo (2 minutes)

Three real papers that genuinely disagree are preloaded:

| Paper | Claim (short) |
|---|---|
| **Adam** (Kingma & Ba, 1412.6980) | Adam converges faster; defaults need no tuning |
| **Wilson et al.** (1705.08292) | Adaptive methods **generalize worse** than SGD — on a constructed separable problem SGD gets 0% test error, Adam ~50% |
| **AdamW** (Loshchilov & Hutter, 1711.05101) | Decoupled weight decay fixes Adam's generalization |

The graph shows 4 cross-paper `CONTRADICTS` edges between their claims.

1. Open the UI — graph of papers, claims, methods, citations, conflicts. Evidence table: *"no runs yet"* on all 9 claims.
2. Click the violet **Linearly separable counterexample** method node → **▶ RUN THIS METHOD**.
3. Watch the experiment console: code generated → executed → `VALIDATES wilson2017-c2 — GD test error 0.000 vs Adam 0.425`.
4. A new ⚡ **Run** node appears in the graph, wired `IMPLEMENTS`→Method and `VALIDATES`→Claims. The evidence table flips live.
5. Ask the agent: *"Which claims now have executable evidence?"* — it queries Neo4j and answers with run ids and exact metrics.

**The result actually reproduces the paper**: Adam's weights equalize exactly as Wilson et al.'s theory predicts (we verified digit-for-digit).

### Sponsor stack

| Partner | How it's used |
|---|---|
| **RocketRide** (local engine) | `pipelines/paper2result.pipe` — wave agent with internal memory, `db_neo4j` tool (natural language → Cypher over the research graph), `tool_python`; LLM routed through one node |
| **Neo4j Aura** | The product *is* the graph: papers, claims, methods, runs, `CONTRADICTS`/`VALIDATES`/`REFUTES` edges |
| **Butterbase** | AI gateway (OpenAI-compatible endpoint powers ALL LLM calls — no separate OpenAI key anywhere) + dedicated app `paper2result` storing papers & run history |
| **Daytona** | Sandbox backend in `app/runner.py` (auto-selected when `DAYTONA_API_KEY` is set; local subprocess fallback keeps the demo unkillable) |

## Run it

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill in: Neo4j, Butterbase, ROCKETRIDE_*
                       # optional: DAYTONA_API_KEY for real sandboxes

.venv/bin/python scripts/check_neo4j.py      # graph connectivity
.venv/bin/python app/graph.py --reset        # load the 3 papers
.venv/bin/python scripts/check_pipeline.py   # RocketRide agent smoke test

.venv/bin/uvicorn app.server:app --port 8787 # → http://localhost:8787
```

One-command closed loop without the UI:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/demo_loop.py wilson2017-m1
# === graph diff ===
#   wilson2017-c1: 'no runs yet' -> 'VALIDATES by run-wilson2017-m1-...'
#   wilson2017-c2: 'no runs yet' -> 'VALIDATES by run-wilson2017-m1-...'
# loop CLOSED ✓
```

Before a live demo: `.venv/bin/python scripts/reset_demo.py` (pristine "no runs yet" state).

## Why this beats "Paper2Code"

Paper2Code stops at code generation. Here, the code **runs**, and the outcome — success, failure, error, metric — becomes a first-class graph citizen attached to the claims it tests. Failed runs are evidence too.

> Research should not end at reading. It should end in evidence.
